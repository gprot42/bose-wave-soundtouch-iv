# Offline USB Firmware Reflash — Bose Wave SoundTouch IV Pedestal

Use this guide when the pedestal is in the **stuck-firmware** state: the
`Bose Wave ST (…)` WiFi AP broadcasts, DHCP hands out leases, and the
speaker is ARP-reachable — but **every TCP port refuses instantly** and no
app (including the official Bose app) can connect. This is not a phone or
app problem. The setup web server inside the pedestal never launched. The
fix is a forced offline firmware reflash via a USB stick.

See [README.SoundTouchIV-wifi.md](../README.SoundTouchIV-wifi.md) for the
full diagnosis and root-cause explanation.

## Why the Bose Updater website no longer works

Bose shut down the SoundTouch cloud servers, including the online
firmware-update servers, on **6 May 2026**. `btu.bose.com` returns 404.
OTA updates are gone. The only remaining path is the **offline USB method**
documented here.

---

## Overview

```
1. Get firmware   →  2. Prepare USB   →  3. Flash pedestal   →  4. Setup WiFi   →  5. Enable SSH   →  6. SoundCork
                                                      ↑ plug Ethernet into pedestal for step 5 (Wave IV)
```

Steps 3 and 5 are **separate pedestal procedures**. Putting both files on one stick
(`--both`) does not enable SSH during the firmware flash. **Step 5 (SSH) on Wave IV
requires an Ethernet cable** plugged into the pedestal's network port — see
[Plug Ethernet before the SSH USB pass](#plug-ethernet-before-the-ssh-usb-pass-wave-iv).

---

## Step 1 — Identify your firmware

The Wave SoundTouch IV pedestal uses the **Bluetooth/SM2 platform** — do
not use the "Non-Bluetooth (2013-2015)" folder. Every firmware file for
your unit is named `Bluetooth_WST4_*.zip`.

### Community firmware archive (Internet Archive)

The full release history is preserved here — this is the only working
source since Bose's own servers are down:

**Browse:**

**Use 27.00.06** (the newest in the archive). If that fails to flash,
try the previous 27.x release, then work backwards.

> **Why not downgrade?** Downgrading is only needed if a specific version
> caused the problem (e.g. an interrupted mid-version update). Start with
> the newest and only go backwards if reflashing the newest fails.

## Step 2 — Prepare the USB stick

### Requirements

- USB-A stick, **32 GB or smaller**
- Partition table: **MBR (Master Boot Record / FDisk)** — GPT will not work;
  the pedestal's embedded USB host stack does not parse GPT
- Filesystem: **FAT32** — not exFAT (pedestal kernel has no exFAT module),
  not NTFS, not FAT16
- Firmware flash: only **`Update.stu`** at the USB root — no folders, no extra files
- SSH enable: only **`remote_services`** at the USB root (see [Flash vs SSH](#flash-vs-ssh-two-separate-procedures))
- SSH enable (Wave IV): an **Ethernet cable** from the pedestal's **network port**
  to your router/switch (see [Plug Ethernet before the SSH USB pass](#plug-ethernet-before-the-ssh-usb-pass-wave-iv))

### Automated method (recommended)

`bose-usb-prep.sh` handles all of the above — format, junk removal,
download, extraction, MD5 verify, and format validation — in one command:

```sh
./bose-usb-prep.sh              # firmware flash only (default)
./bose-usb-prep.sh --both       # both files on stick — still two pedestal passes
./bose-usb-prep.sh --ssh        # SSH-only stick (use after flash + WiFi setup)
./bose-usb-prep.sh --dry-run    # preview all steps without writing anything
```

### Flash vs SSH: two separate procedures

`bose-usb-prep.sh --both` writes **`Update.stu`** and **`remote_services`** onto
the same USB stick. That saves you from preparing two sticks, but it does **not**
run both operations in one insertion. The pedestal treats them as different
boot-time behaviors:

| | Firmware flash | SSH enable |
|---|----------------|------------|
| **USB file** | `Update.stu` | `remote_services` (empty, no extension) |
| **When** | Stuck firmware / first recovery | After flash and WiFi setup, before SoundCork |
| **Ethernet** | Not required | **Required on Wave IV** — plug into pedestal **network port** before power-on |
| **Power state** | Powered on, or power-cycle + Control button | **Power off** → insert USB → power on |
| **USB port** | SETUP / SETUP B / SERVICE jack | **Setup B** (USB-A on pedestal back) |
| **Success signal** | Pedestal reboots on its own | `ssh root@<ip>` connects (port 22 open) |
| **After** | Remove USB, enter setup mode | `touch /mnt/nv/remote_services` to persist |

**Common mistake:** run `--both`, flash firmware, remove the USB, join home WiFi,
then try `ssh` — and get `Connection refused`. The flash path processed
`Update.stu`; `remote_services` was never consumed because you never did the
SSH power-cycle pass.

**Recommended workflow:**

1. `./bose-usb-prep.sh` or `./bose-usb-prep.sh --both` — flash the pedestal.
2. Remove USB when the pedestal reboots. Complete WiFi setup (Step 4).
3. `./bose-usb-prep.sh --ssh` — prepare an **SSH-only** stick (no `Update.stu`).
4. **Plug Ethernet** from the pedestal **network port** to your router (see below).
5. Power off → insert SSH stick into **Setup B** → power on → wait ~90 s.
6. From your Mac on the **home LAN** (not the Bose setup SSID): `ssh root@<speaker-ip>`
   then `touch /mnt/nv/remote_services`. Use the router's Ethernet DHCP lease.

Use `--ssh` for step 3, not the original `--both` stick. If `Update.stu` is still
on the stick, re-inserting it may trigger another firmware update instead of SSH.

> **Wave IV caveat:** The `remote_services` USB method is documented for SoundTouch
> speakers and works on many units. Some Wave SoundTouch IV owners report SSH still
> refusing after the correct procedure ([soundcork#309](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork/issues/309)).
> If that happens, confirm Ethernet is plugged in, try a different USB 2.0 stick,
> and confirm the stick has only `remote_services` with no macOS junk files.

### Plug Ethernet before the SSH USB pass (Wave IV)

The pedestal back has **two different connectors** — do not confuse them:

| Jack | Label | Used for |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Setup B** | SETUP / SETUP B / SERVICE | USB stick (`Update.stu` or `remote_services`) |
| **Network port** | network / computer-setup (RJ45) | **Ethernet cable to your router** |

For the SSH enable pass, **both** are used at once:

1. Run `./bose-usb-prep.sh --ssh` and eject the stick.
2. Confirm the speaker is on home WiFi and port **8090** works (BosMan can reach it).
3. **Plug an Ethernet cable** into the pedestal **network port** and your router or
   switch. Leave WiFi configured — Ethernet gives you a reachable IP when the SSH
   USB boot drops WiFi back to the `Bose Wave ST` setup AP.
4. Power off → insert the SSH stick into **Setup B** → power on → wait ~90 s.
5. On your Mac, stay on the **home LAN**. Check your router's DHCP client list for a
   new **Ethernet** lease (not the Bose SSID).
6. `ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -o PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -l root <speaker-ip>`
7. `touch /mnt/nv/remote_services`, remove the USB stick, power-cycle.

The network port is **not** where the USB stick goes. Firmware flash and SSH USB
both use **Setup B** only; Ethernet is an extra cable for SSH so you can reach
port 22 after the boot.

### SSH boot drops WiFi (Wave IV)

On the Wave SoundTouch IV pedestal, powering on with a `remote_services` USB stick
in **Setup B** often triggers a **service boot path** that does **not** rejoin your
home WiFi. Typical symptoms:

- The speaker never appears in your router's DHCP client list
- The `Bose Wave ST (…)` setup AP comes back
- You have to join that AP and re-enter your home WiFi password in BosMan

This is **not** a router DHCP problem. The pedestal never became a WiFi client — it
fell back to setup mode. The setup AP does hand out leases (`192.0.2.x` or
`192.168.1.x`), but that is the speaker's own network, not your LAN.

**Recommended fix — use Ethernet for the SSH pass:**

1. Confirm the speaker is already on home WiFi and port **8090** works.
2. Plug an **Ethernet cable** into the pedestal's **network port** (not the Setup
   USB jack).
3. Power off → insert the SSH-only USB into **Setup B** → power on → wait ~60 s.
4. Find the speaker's IP in your router's DHCP list (often under the Ethernet
   interface).
5. `ssh root@<speaker-ip>` then `touch /mnt/nv/remote_services`.
6. **Remove the USB stick** and power-cycle normally (no USB inserted).
7. WiFi should come back on its own. If it does not, do the BosMan setup pass once
   more — that should be the last time.

**After SSH works:** always run `touch /mnt/nv/remote_services` on the speaker and
remove the USB. That persists SSH in internal storage so future reboots do not need
another USB pass — and WiFi is more likely to survive the next boot.

### SSH connection refused (Wave IV)

`ssh: connect to host 192.0.2.1 port 22: Connection refused` after joining the
`Bose Wave ST (…)` setup AP is a common false alarm. It usually means **SSH was
never enabled**, not that your Mac cannot reach the speaker.

On Wave IV, three separate things get conflated:

| What you see | What it means |
|--------------|---------------|
| `Bose Wave ST` AP is broadcasting | Pedestal is in (or fell back to) setup mode — expected after many SSH USB boots |
| `192.0.2.1` responds to ping / ARP | Setup AP network is alive |
| Port **22** `Connection refused` | Nothing is listening for SSH — `remote_services` was **not** consumed, or Wave IV never started `sshd` |

SSH on Bose firmware listens on the **home LAN / Ethernet** interface. It is
**not** generally reachable on the setup AP gateway (`192.0.2.1`). Testing SSH
while joined to the Bose SSID is therefore the wrong test on Wave IV.

**How to tell whether the USB stick was read**

During power-on with the stick in **Setup B**, watch the pedestal **WiFi LED**:

- **Blinks white** for a while → pedestal is reading/processing the USB (good sign)
- **Never changes** → stick not detected — recheck port, FAT32/MBR, junk files, try another USB 2.0 drive

**Verify the stick on your computer** (before inserting it):

```sh
ls -la /Volumes/BOSEFLASH/
# Expected: exactly one visible file named remote_services (zero bytes)
# Must NOT contain: Update.stu, .DS_Store, ._*, .fseventsd, .Spotlight-V100
```

Re-prepare with the prep script (sets MBR boot flag for SSH sticks):

```sh
./bose-usb-prep.sh --ssh
```

**Correct SSH test procedure**

1. Speaker was on home WiFi with port **8090** working **before** the SSH pass.
2. Plug **Ethernet** into the pedestal network port.
3. Power off → insert SSH-only USB in **Setup B** → power on → wait ~90 s.
4. Stay on your **home WiFi/Ethernet** network on the Mac — do **not** join the Bose SSID.
5. Find the speaker in your router DHCP list (often a second lease on Ethernet).
6. `ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -o PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -l root <speaker-ip>`

Modern OpenSSH disables `ssh-rsa`; add those options if you get algorithm errors.
Example: `ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -o PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -l root 192.168.0.119`

**If port 22 still refuses on the home/Ethernet IP**

The USB `remote_services` method is documented for standalone SoundTouch 10/20/30
speakers. Multiple Wave SoundTouch IV owners report it **never enables SSH** even
with a correct stick ([soundcork#309](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork/issues/309)).
That points to a **firmware/platform limitation**, not a formatting typo.

Things still worth trying:

- A different small **USB 2.0** stick (re-prepared with `bose-usb-prep.sh --ssh`)
- Confirm **Setup B** (USB-A), not Setup A / Micro-USB OTG
- Leave the stick inserted through the full ~90 s boot — do not remove early
- After re-provisioning WiFi, check whether port **17000** answers on the home IP
  (some Wave IV units expose a limited TAP console there — do **not** send exploratory
  commands; `demo enter` can brick the unit)

If nothing opens port 22, SoundCork server redirect via SSH is not available on that
pedestal today. Local control via BosMan on port **8090** still works once WiFi is set up.

### Manual method

**macOS:**
```sh
diskutil list   # find your USB — look for "external"
diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 BOSEFLASH MBRFormat /dev/diskN
```

**Windows:**
Use the [HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/hp-usb-disk-storage-format-tool/) —
choose FAT32, leave all other options unchecked. Windows cannot natively
format drives >32 GB as FAT32 — use this tool regardless of size.

**Linux:**
```sh
parted -s /dev/sdX mklabel msdos
parted -s /dev/sdX mkpart primary fat32 1MiB 100%
mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n BOSEFLASH /dev/sdX1
```

### macOS junk files — CRITICAL

macOS silently creates hidden files on every FAT32 volume that **prevent
the pedestal from detecting the firmware file**. Remove them after copying:

```sh
mdutil -i off /Volumes/BOSEFLASH
rm -rf /Volumes/BOSEFLASH/.fseventsd /Volumes/BOSEFLASH/.Spotlight-V100
rm -f  /Volumes/BOSEFLASH/._* /Volumes/BOSEFLASH/.DS_Store
```

Run these commands **after** copying `Update.stu` — macOS recreates the
`._Update.stu` AppleDouble file whenever you write to the volume.

### Extract and copy the firmware file

1. Download the zip (e.g. `Bluetooth_WST4_Update_ti_27.00.06…zip`)
2. Unzip it — you will find a file called **`Update.stu`** inside
3. Copy **only `Update.stu`** to the **root of the USB stick** — do not
   put it inside any folder
4. Remove macOS junk files (see above)
5. Eject the USB stick safely

Your USB stick should look like this:

```
BOSEFLASH/
└── Update.stu        ← the only file on the drive
```

---

## Step 3 — Flash the pedestal

> **Important — this is a two-unit system.** The Wave SoundTouch IV is a
> **Wave console** (top unit: display, numbered buttons 1–6, volume, radio/CD)
> sitting on a **SoundTouch pedestal** (bottom unit: WiFi/Bluetooth radios,
> the firmware brain, the USB port, and a single **Control button** on the
> back), joined by the Bose link cable. **The pedestal is what flashes
> `Update.stu`.** The console's numbered buttons have nothing to do with the
> firmware update.

The firmware USB port is on the **pedestal**, labelled **SETUP / SETUP B /
SERVICE** (next to the Control button and the Bose link connector).

> **Which port?** Use the jack labelled **SETUP / SETUP B / SERVICE** only —
> not the network/computer-setup port. Some pedestal revisions use a
> **Micro-USB** SETUP jack, which needs a USB-A-female → Micro-USB-male
> adapter for a standard USB stick.

> **Do NOT use the "Button 4 + Volume Down" sequence.** That is the procedure
> for **standalone SoundTouch 10/20/30 speakers**, where the USB port and the
> numbered buttons are on the same unit. On the Wave SoundTouch IV those
> buttons are on the console and do not drive the pedestal — holding them
> just boots normally to `SOUNDTOUCH NOT CONFIGURED`.

### Method 1 — auto-flash (primary, no buttons)

1. Leave the system **powered ON**.
2. **Insert the USB stick** into the pedestal's **SETUP / SETUP B / SERVICE**
   jack (use a Micro-USB adapter if that jack is Micro-USB).
3. Wait **30 seconds to a few minutes**. The pedestal **reboots on its own**
   when the flash completes — that is the success signal.
4. **Do not touch the console's numbered buttons.**

### Method 2 — pedestal Control button (fallback)

If Method 1 produces no reboot:

1. **Unplug the AC power cord** completely.
2. **Insert the USB** into the SETUP / SETUP B / SERVICE jack.
3. Press and **hold the Control button on the BACK of the pedestal**.
4. While still holding, **reconnect AC power**. Keep holding ~5 seconds,
   then release.
5. Wait up to 5 minutes — the pedestal reboots automatically when done.

### Signs the flash is working

- Pedestal **WiFi LED blinks white** (it is reading/processing the USB)
- Display may show a progress bar, "UPDATE", or "PLEASE WAIT", or go blank
- Pedestal **reboots on its own** after ~30 s to a few minutes

### Signs something went wrong

- **`SOUNDTOUCH NOT CONFIGURED`** appears and nothing else happens → the
  pedestal booted normally without reading the USB. Most common causes:
  wrong jack (use SETUP/SETUP B/SERVICE, add a Micro-USB adapter if needed),
  macOS junk files on the stick (re-run `bose-usb-prep.sh`), or the drive
  is not being enumerated — try a different small USB 2.0 drive
- **WiFi LED never changes** → the stick is not being read at all; recheck
  the jack, FAT32 format, and try another drive
- **LED blinks white 3× then goes amber** → the USB was read but the
  firmware was rejected; try the previous firmware version
  (`./bose-usb-prep.sh --version 27.00.03`, then `26.00.01`)
- Pedestal reboots into the same stuck state → try the previous firmware
  version and repeat the procedure

---

## Step 4 — Verify and enter setup mode

After the reflash reboot:

1. Remove the USB stick.
2. Wait 60 seconds for the system to fully boot.
3. **Hold the Control button** on the back of the pedestal for ~3 seconds.
4. The WiFi light should go **solid amber** and the display should show
   **`SETUP SEE INSTRUCTIONS`**.
5. On your phone, join the `Bose Wave ST (…)` WiFi network and tap
   **Stay connected** when Android warns about no internet.
6. Open **BosMan** — the WiFi Setup panel should now be able to reach the
   speaker at `192.0.2.1` (or `192.168.1.1`) on port 80.
7. Pick your home WiFi, enter the password, submit. The pedestal reboots
   onto your home network. The `Bose Wave ST` AP disappears.

If setup mode still produces no port-80 response after reflashing, see
the [Field diagnostics section of README.SoundTouchIV-wifi.md](../README.SoundTouchIV-wifi.md#field-diagnostics-hard-won-read-this-before-debugging)
for how to probe directly through the app.

---

## Step 5 — Replace the dead Bose cloud with SoundCork

Once the pedestal is on your home WiFi and reachable on port 8090, the
speaker works locally (BosMan can control it). However the **Bose cloud is
permanently gone** (shut down 6 May 2026), so:

- TuneIn presets no longer resolve
- The official Bose SoundTouch app loses most functionality
- You cannot configure new presets via the cloud

**SoundCork** is a self-hosted drop-in replacement for all four Bose cloud
servers. You run it on a Raspberry Pi, NAS, Docker host, or any always-on
machine, and redirect the speaker's cloud traffic to your server.

### Resources

- Speaker setup guide: <https://github.com/timvw/soundcork/blob/main/docs/speaker-setup.md>
- Companion CLI: <https://github.com/timvw/bose>
- Write-up: [Keep your Bose SoundTouch alive after the shutdown](https://timvw.be/2026/02/17/keep-your-bose-soundtouch-speaker-alive-after-the-shutdown/)

### SoundCork setup in brief

The full procedure is in the [speaker-setup guide](https://github.com/timvw/soundcork/blob/main/docs/speaker-setup.md).
Summary:

#### 1. Enable SSH on the pedestal (USB method)

This is a **separate procedure** from the firmware flash in Steps 2–4. If you
used `--both` earlier, that only put both files on the stick — you still need
this pass after WiFi setup. Prepare an SSH-only stick:

```sh
./bose-usb-prep.sh --ssh
```

Or manually: create a **blank file called `remote_services`** (no extension) at
the root of a clean FAT32 USB stick. On macOS, remove junk files first (same
commands as Step 2 above). The stick must **not** contain `Update.stu`.

```
BOSEFLASH/
└── remote_services       ← empty file, no extension
```

Then on the pedestal (speaker must already be on home WiFi):

1. **Plug Ethernet** into the pedestal **network port** (RJ45) and your router —
   required on Wave IV; see [Plug Ethernet before the SSH USB pass](#plug-ethernet-before-the-ssh-usb-pass-wave-iv).
2. Power off completely (pull AC cord)
3. Insert the stick into **Setup B** (USB-A jack on the pedestal back — not the network port)
4. Power on and wait ~90 seconds
5. Stay on your **home LAN** on the Mac (do not join the `Bose Wave ST` SSID).
6. SSH in — no password required:

```sh
ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -o PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -l root <speaker-ip>
# Example: ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -o PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -l root 192.168.0.119
```

Use `-l root` (or `root@`) — `ssh <ip>` alone tries your Mac username and will
fail even when SSH is running.

Find the speaker's IP from your router's DHCP list (Ethernet is more reliable than
WiFi for this boot on Wave IV) or:

```sh
# Once BosMan found it on port 8090, the IP is shown in the app
# Or check your router, or:
curl -s http://<speaker-ip>:8090/info | grep -o 'ipAddress>[^<]*' | head -1
```

#### 2. Extract speaker data

```sh
curl http://<speaker-ip>:8090/presets    > Presets.xml
curl http://<speaker-ip>:8090/recents    > Recents.xml
curl http://<speaker-ip>:8090/info       > DeviceInfo.xml

# Sources.xml (Spotify tokens) — requires SSH:
ssh root@<speaker-ip> cat /mnt/nv/BoseApp-Persistence/1/Sources.xml > Sources.xml
```

Get your account UUID from `DeviceInfo.xml` — look for `margeAccountUUID`.

#### 3. Run SoundCork and redirect the speaker

Follow the [SoundCork README](https://github.com/timvw/soundcork) to
start the server, then on the pedestal:

```sh
ssh root@<speaker-ip>
rw    # make filesystem read-write
vi /opt/Bose/etc/SoundTouchSdkPrivateCfg.xml
```

Change all four server URLs to your SoundCork instance:

| Server | Original | Replace with |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| marge | `https://streaming.bose.com` | `https://your-soundcork-server` |
| bmx | `https://content.api.bose.io` | `https://your-soundcork-server` |
| updates | `https://worldwide.bose.com` | `https://your-soundcork-server` |
| stats | `https://events.api.bosecm.com` | `https://your-soundcork-server` |

Reboot the speaker. TuneIn presets and streaming resume through your
SoundCork server.

#### 4. Make SSH persistent (optional but recommended)

```sh
ssh root@<speaker-ip>
touch /mnt/nv/remote_services
```

This keeps SSH accessible across reboots so you can manage SoundCork
config without re-inserting the USB each time. **Remove the USB stick** after
running this — leaving it inserted can cause odd boots on the next power cycle.
